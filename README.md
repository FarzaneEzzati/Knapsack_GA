# Knapsack_GA
This is a python code to solve a knapsack problem using Genetic Algorithm. I am not a python professional, but I tried to keep it simple and efficient.

In this case, the algorithm solve a knapsack problem containing 20 weighted items with their impotance value. The termination threshold is set to 0.8, 
weight limit to 4500 gr, mutation rate to 0.7, and the first generation has 10 feasible solutions. 

Just change the weights, their importance, number of generated feasible solutions, and rates to have your own problem.

All the lines (most of them to say the least) have comments explaining the code :)

Good luck
